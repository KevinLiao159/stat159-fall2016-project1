# Introduction

First of all, before we start to throw out technical terms and potentially confuse everyone. We would like discusss why reproducible workflow is important. During the lecture, we learned that the Potti scandal damaged reputation of a top research institution and took away hopes from people with desperate illness. 

The following content of the paper will present the solutions to create a reproducible workflow. It allows readers and other researchers to reproduce their research and draw to the same conclusion. To make workflow reproducible, we need a series of advanced tools to accomplish this goal. 

At the beginning of any project, we need to make sure there is only one version of the work in the middle of research. In order to acchieve such a goal, we need **Git**. **Git** is an open source distributed version control system that helps people keep track of changes they made to documents.

**Git** is a version control system working on one's local address. How about we need some tools like dropbox where we can co-operate and work each part remotely. Now we need **GitHub**. **GitHub** is a web-based Git repository hosting service. 

Next concern is what format do our paper use? We use **Markdown**. **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.

Now that we have **Markdown**. But how do we convert paper's text to **Markdown**. To bridge this gap, we will use **Pandoc**. **Pandoc** is a free and open-source software document converter.

How about compiling file together? We will use **Makefile**. And we will talk more about the **Makefile** in our main discussion in the paper.

Now We believe everyone should have a general idea of why and how make workflow reproducible is important. We will extend this concepts to next part of the paper -- Main Discusion
