Being able to carry out reproducibility will increase transparancy of research procedure and reduce fraudulent incidents.## Introduction</h2>
<h2 id="we-will-use-multiple-programming-tools-to-acchieve-our-goal.-following-tools-will-be-introduced-in-this-paper-bash-markdown-pandoc-git-github-make.-and-we-will-describe-roles-of-each-of-tools-we-used.-main-discussion">We will use multiple programming tools to acchieve our goal. Following tools will be introduced in this paper: bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, Make. And we will describe roles of each of tools we used. ## Main discussion</h2>
<h2 id="makefile"># Makefile</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Let's talk about makefile first. Makefile is an automation tool that compiles and links different scripts or files together. The rule in makefile is that the target depends on dependencies and there is a command below the target and dependencies. A makefile is executed with the make command, e.g. make [target1...]</p></li>
<li><p>Makefile plays an important role in reproducibility because it can shorten the compiling process and so it reduces chances of potential errors that are created during a complicated data compiling process.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="git"># Git</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Git is a version control system for programming developers. Every git repository on every computer has full version-tracking capabilities and is independent of network access</p></li>
<li><p>Git also plays an important role in reproducible workflow. It allows each team member contribute their work without overwriting each other. At the same time, it also allows each contribution merges together. Besides team work aspects, git can keep track of modifications of files. Any changes in git can be traced back and examined. It allows follower fellows to reproduce the same work.</p></li>
