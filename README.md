### Kevin Liao's First Project

This repository holds the information of fall 2016 first reproducible project. This project aims to utilize what we have so far learned in Statistics 159 - Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science and write a paper upon how these concepts are developed.

Course website: [gastonsanchez.com/stat159](http://gastonsanchez.com/stat159)

Project instruction: [github project repository](https://github.com/ucb-stat159/stat159-fall-2016/tree/master/projects)

This paper describes the working process of creating this paper (just like writing a blog about how to write a blog). The following concepts are discussed in detail through the paper:

* Basic Structure of GitHub
    * README File
    * Makefile
    * .gitignore
    * License
* Git
* Markdown File
* Pandoc


Besides the basic concepts, the paper mainly includes personal experience from the production process, such as what are easy parts, the challenging parts and the time-consuming parts, so that the readers can get a better understanding of the structure and successfully reproduce the work. All the information are trackable so that anyone who is interested in using this work can build meaningful ideas upon it.


The paper is separated into four sections:
1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Discussion
4. Conclusion
